Create a new application for an existing candidate or prospect.

The new application can be a candidate application or a prospect application, depending on the `"prospect"` parameter which defaults to `"false"`.  The JSON body parameters differ depending on whether you are creating a prospect application or a candidate application.  The main difference is that prospect applications can be considered for zero, one, or multiple jobs.

### HTTP Request

`POST https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/applications/{id}/attachments`

### Headers

Header | Description
--------- | -----------
On-Behalf-Of | ID of the user issuing this request. Required for auditing purposes.


### JSON Body Parameters

Parameter | Required | Type | Description
--------- | ----------- | ----------- | -----------
filename | Yes | string | Name of the file
type | Yes | string | One of: ["resume", "cover_letter", "other", "take_home_test", "offer_letter", "signed_offer_letter"]. For type `take_home_test`, there must be an outstanding test on the application. For type `offer_letter`, there must be an existing offer on the application, and this action will retrigger the approvals process. For type `signed_offer_letter`, there must be an approved, sent offer letter.
content | No | string | Base64 encoded content of the attachment (if you are providing content, you do not need to provide url). String must be UTF-8 encoded.
url | No | string | Url of the attachment (if you are providing the url, you do not need to provide the content.) _Please note, shareable links from cloud services such as Google Drive will result in a corrupted file. Please use machine-accessible URLs._
visibility | No | string | One of: ["public", "private", "admin_only"]. This only applies when attachment type is "other", and will be ignored for all other attachment types. If not supplied, type "other" documents will default to `admin_only`. Resumes, cover letters, and take home tests will always be `public`. Offer letters and signed offer letters will always be `private`.
content_type | Yes* | string | The content-type of the document you are sending. When using a URL, this generally isn't needed, as the responding server will deliver a content type.  This should be included for encoded content.
