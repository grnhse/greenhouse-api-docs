### Questions / Location Questions / Compliance

Possible field types:

| Type | How to represent |
|------|------------------|
| input_file | Represent with an input of type file |
| input_text | Represent with an input of type text |
| input_hidden | Represent with an input of type hidden |
| textarea | Represent with a textarea |
| multi_value_single_select | Can be represented as either a set of radio buttons or a select
| multi_value_multi_select | Can be represented as either a set of checkboxes or a multi-select

Please note that it is possible for multiple fields to be aggregated beneath a single question. The "Resume" field is a prime example, with both an input_file and textarea type accepted. If marked as required, then we expect at least one of these fields to contain a valid value when your form is submitted to the [application submission](#applications) endpoint.

### Demographic Questions

| Type | How to represent |
|------|------------------|
| multi_value_single_select | Can be represented as either a set of radio buttons or a select
| multi_value_multi_select | Can be represented as either a set of checkboxes or a multi-select

For organizations using Greenhouse Inclusion, the response may contain demographic questions. Each question contains an array of answer options that may be rendered based on the question 'type' defined in the table above. The candidate must select an answer option for questions with `required` set to `true`. If an answer option is selected that has `free_form` set to `true`, the candidate must be allowed to type a free-form response. This free-form response is only required if no other answer options have been selected by the candidate.

### Data Compliance

Responses may include `data_compliance` objects if your organization is using GDPR rules and 'explicit consent' legal basis. The object includes whether a response is required, and configured data retention period (in days) for the associated rule.

### Board-level Introductions and Conclusions

For organizations with Default Descriptions authored on the Job Board, the `content` field will include the Board-level Introduction, Post-level Description, and Board-level Conclusion as a single concatenated string.
