EXAMPLE FORM BELOW (simplified):

Please keep in mind that the HTTP Basic Auth API token is a secret key.  Any form posts should be proxied by your own servers.  Any direct post to the /applications POST method would reveal your secret key to anybody that views source--which would be a very bad thing.

Use this endpoint to submit a new application. This endpoint accepts a multipart form POST representing a job application. Application forms are job-specific and will be constructed via the "questions" array available via the [Job method](#retrieve-a-job). Please see the [Job method](#retrieve-a-job) documentation for instructions on submitting location information through the API.

Note that when submitting an application through this method, Greenhouse will not confirm the inclusion of required fields. Validation for required fields must be done on the client side, as Greenhouse will not reject applications that are missing required fields.

<aside class="warning">
  This method requires HTTP Basic Auth over SSL/TLS: the Basic Auth username is your API key (found on the API Credentials page). No password is required.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
  In general, we would encourage customers to make use of the Embedded Job Application before going to the trouble of building their own form. Our application form is well tested, validated, battle-hardened, and has built-in spam protection measures. Building your own form can introduce a number of challenges which are typically not worth the additional effort.

### HTTP Request

`POST https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{board_token}/jobs/{id}`

Parameter | Description
 --------- | -----------
 board_token | Job Board URL token.  If you're submitting an application for a job post on an internal job board, use `"internal"`.
 id | Job post ID. Both internal and external job posts are allowed.

### Request Headers

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
Authorization | This header should include a basic authorization with a **Base64 encoded** API key
Content-Type | Required if the request contains an attachment

### Request Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
*mapped_url_token | If present, the `gh_src` URL parameter, which is used to indicate the referral source of this application.
first_name | Applicant's first name
last_name | Applicant's last name
email | Applicant's email address
*phone | Applicant's phone number
*location | Applicant's street address
*latitude | Applicant's home latitude. This is a *hidden* field and should not be exposed directly to the applicant.
*longitude | Applicant's home longitude. This is a *hidden* field and should not be exposed directly to the applicant.
*resume | *Please see below for details.*
*cover_letter | *Please see below for details.*
*educations | An array of education objects. Each education object should have five fields: `school_name_id`, `degree_id`, `discipline_id`, `start_date`, and `end_date`. You can get the `school_name_id`, `degree_id`, `discipline_id` from our [List Schools](#list-schools), [List Degrees](#list-degrees), and [List Disciplines](#list-disciplines) endpoints. `start_date` and `end_date` will use a hash of month and year.
*employments | An array of employments objects. Each employment object should have: `company_name`, `title`, `start_date`, and `current` (must be `true` or `false`). If `current` is `false`, must have `end_date`. `start_date` and `end_date` will use a hash of month and year.
*demographic_answers | An array of demographic answer objects, applicable only if your organization has Greenhouse Inclusion and demographic questions are enabled on the job post. Each object must have a `question_id` field. The `answer_options` field is an array of objects, one for each `answer_option_id` the candidate selected. For answer options which support free-form responses, a `text` field may also be supplied with the candidate's hand-typed answer. Note that these questions are always optional, so the `answer_options` array may be empty, null, or omitted if the candidate did not make any selections.
*data_compliance | An object representing a candidate’s answers to required data compliance questions. This field is dependent on your organization’s [privacy and compliance configuration](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360061849112-GDPR-features-overview). If your organization doesn't have single-purpose consent configured, use `{"gdpr_consent_given": true}`. Otherwise use separate consent values, like `{"gdpr_processing_consent_given":true}` or `{gdpr_retention_consent_given":false.}`.

### Collecting Applicant Location

Here is the suggested workflow for populating `location`, `latitude` and `longitude`:

1. The applicant begins typing a location in your `location` text box.
2. As the applicant types, your app makes a call to the [Google Places Autocomplete API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places-autocomplete)
to retrieve suggested location names (e.g. New York, NY, United States)
and the `place_id` associated with each location (e.g. `ChIJOwg_06VPwokRYv534QaPC8g`).
3. Your app displays the suggested location names to the applicant.
4. The applicant selects a suggested location.
5. Your app uses the `place_id` from the previous API call to retrieve the latitude and
longitude for the selected location using the [Google Place Details API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#place_details).
6. Your app populates the hidden `latitude` and `longitude` fields with the result of
this API call.

Note that all 3 fields must be included. If only `location` is sent and `latitude` and `longitude` are omitted, `location` will be ignored entirely.

### Validations on POST Requests

**Job validations:**

* The job must be live and published
* The job board must be live and published
* The job post ID must exist on the job board with the supplied board_token

**Field validations:** 

* `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email` fields are required 
* `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email` fields cannot be greater than 255 characters long
* `first_name`, `last_name`, and `phone` fields must not contain a URL
* `email` field must contain a valid email address
* `educations` object must contain valid `school_name_id`, `degree_id`, `discipline_id`, `start_date`, and `end_date`
* `employments` object must contain `company_name`, `title`, `start_date` and `current` (must be `true` or `false`). If *current=false*, must contain `end_date`
* `start_date` must be before `end_date`
* Field values must match the field type specified on the job post question

**Attachments:**

* Must be a supported file type (pdf, doc, docx, txt, rtf)
* File size must be > 0 bytes
